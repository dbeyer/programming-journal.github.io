### Abstract

This paper presents Skini, a programming methodology and an execution
environment for interactive structured music. With this system, the
composer programs his scores in the HipHop.js synchronous reactive
language. They are then executed, or played, in live concerts, in
interaction with the audience. The system aims at helping composers to
find a good balance between the determinism of the compositions and the
nondeterminism of the interactions with the public. Each execution of a
Skini score yields to a different but aesthetically consistent
interpretation.

This work raises many questions in the musical fields. How to combine
composition and interaction? How to control the musical style when the
audience influences what is to play next? What are the possible
connections with generative music? These are important questions for the
Skini system but they are out of the scope of this paper that focuses
exclusively on the computer science aspects of the system. From that
perspective, the main questions are how to program the scores and in
which language? General purpose languages are inappropriate because
their elementary constructs (i.e., variables, functions, loops, etc.) do
not match the constructions needed to express music and musical
constraints. We show that synchronous programming languages are a much
better fit because they rely on temporal constructs that can be directly
used to represent musical scores and because their malleability enables
composers to experiment easily with artistic variations of their initial
scores.

The paper mostly focuses on scores programming. It exposes the process a
composer should follow from his very first musical intuitions up to the
generation of a musical artifact. The paper presents some excerpts of
the programming of a classical music composition that it then precisely
relates to an actual recording. Examples of techno music and jazz are
also presented, with audio artifact, to demonstrate the versatility of
the system. Finally, brief presentations of past live concerts are
presented as an evidence of viability of the system.
