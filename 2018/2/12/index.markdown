### Abstract

Computer science provides an in-depth understanding of technical aspects of
programming concepts, but if we want to understand how programming concepts evolve, how programmers 
think and talk about them and how they are used in practice, we need to consider a broader 
perspective that includes historical, philosophical and cognitive aspects.
In this paper, we develop such broader understanding of monads, a programming concept that has 
an infamous formal definition, syntactic support in several programming languages and a reputation 
for being elegant and powerful, but also intimidating and difficult to grasp. 

This paper is not a monad tutorial. It will not tell you what a monad is. Instead, it helps you 
understand how computer scientists and programmers talk about monads and why they do so. To answer 
these questions, we review the history of monads in the context of programming and study the development
through the perspectives of philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics and cognitive sciences.

More generally, we present a framework for understanding programming concepts that considers them 
at three levels: formal, metaphorical and implementation. 
We base such observations on established results about the scientific method and mathematical 
entities — cognitive sciences suggest that the metaphors used when thinking about monads
are more important than widely accepted, while philosophy of science explains how the research 
paradigm from which monads originate influences and restricts their use. 

Finally, we provide evidence for why a broader philosophical, sociological look at programming 
concepts should be of interest for programmers. It lets us understand programming concepts better 
and, fundamentally, choose more appropriate abstractions as illustrated in a number of case studies
that conclude the paper.
