### Abstract
Computer programs do not always work as expected. In fact, ominous warnings about the desperate 
state of the software industry continue to be released with almost ritualistic regularity.
In this paper, we look at the 60 years history of programming and at the different practical 
methods that software community developed to live with programming errors.

We do so by observing a class of students discussing different approaches to programming errors.
While learning about the different methods for dealing with errors, we uncover basic assumptions
that proponents of different paradigms follow. We learn about the mathematical attempt to eliminate 
errors through formal methods, scientific method based on testing, a way of building reliable
systems through engineering methods, as well as an artistic approach to live coding that accepts 
errors as a creative inspiration.

This way, we can explore the differences and similarities among the different paradigms. By 
inviting proponents of different methods into a single discussion, we hope to open potential for
new thinking about errors. When should we use which of the approaches? And what can software 
development learn from mathematics, science, engineering and art? 

When programming or studying programming, we are often enclosed in small communities and we
take our basic assumptions for granted. Through the discussion in this paper, we attempt to 
map the large and rich space of programming ideas and provide reference points for exploring,
perhaps foreign, ideas that can challenge some of our assumptions.
